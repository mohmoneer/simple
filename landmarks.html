                <img src="img/London%20Eye.webp">
                <p>
                    Perhaps one of the most recognisable and famous landmarks in Britain is the London Eye. This giant Ferris wheel that spins above the River Thames offers 360-degree views of the capital and has 32 pods that each represent a London borough.

                    Riding the London Eye is an enjoyable activity that allows you to see the pretty London skyline from a new angle. You can even sip champagne as you relax in one of the more decadent pods. The London Eye is a London landmark that you should experience at least once in your life.

                <h3>Big Ben, London, England</h3>
                <img src="img/Big%20Ben.webp">
                <p>
                    Situated near the River Thames, Big Ben stands to the north of Westminster Palace. It is entertaining to catch Big Ben on the hour and waiting to hear his chimes ring out across the city of London. It is a must for any London bucket list!

                    At nearly 200 years old, Big Ben is one of the iconic British landmarks. Tourists from all around the world gather to see this famous clock throughout the day. This is also a great photo opportunity, and the backdrop of Westminster looks stunning against Big Ben’s gothic architectural style.

                <h3>Westminster Abbey, London, England</h3>
                <img src="img/Westminster%20Abbey.webp">
                <p>
                    Westminster Abbey is a UNESCO World Heritage Site where royalty gathers for coronations and weddings. This gothic style church is next to the parliament, and you can visit the inside to see the beautiful stained-glass windows and historical tombs. You should definitely consider adding it to your London 4 day itinerary!

                    The cathedral is an imposing building and an important part of British Royal history. The details on the outside and inside of the Abbey are breathtaking. Tiny statues adorn the entryways, and the towers are magnificent. It is good to see the church before or after visiting Big Ben since they are close to each other.

                <h3>Tower of London, London, England</h3>
                <img src="img/Tower%20of%20London.webp">
                <p>
                    This is a really famous landmark in London, known for being the 900-year-old fortress that protects the crown jewels and previously held infamous prisoners. Not many big cities have castles in the middle of them, so the Tower of London is definitely worth visiting when in London for a weekend!

                    You can book a tour of this eerie castle to see royal artefacts and meet the Yeoman Warders – aka Beefeaters – that used to imprison and execute hundreds of traitors throughout history.

                <img src="img/Tower%20Bridge.webp">
                <p>
                    Tower Bridge is a famous bridge in London with a distinct blue steel structure. This bridge is open to pedestrians at all times, and the walk across is not only just a great photo opportunity but also allows you to learn more about the history of the bridge.

                    If just walking across the bridge is not enough, you can go inside the bridge and learn even more about how and when it was built and why the steel is such a striking blue colour. At certain times, the bridge opens to allow tall ships to pass through, and it is exhilarating to see such a historic bridge still working today.
