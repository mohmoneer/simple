                <h2>United Kingdom Cultures</h2>
                <p>
                    The United Kingdom is about the same size of the U.S. state of Oregon and comprises the entire island of Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) and Northern Ireland. The population of the UK is primarily Caucasian (87 percent), with black (3 percent), Indian (2 percent), and Pakistani (2 percent) making up the remaining population. Most people in the UK live in England, followed by Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Generally, Britons appreciate emotional control. Effusive behavior may be perceived as embarrassing. Scottish and Welsh people tend to possess a strong sense of nationalism.

                    <h3>Family Dynamic</h3>
                    <p>
                        British families are traditionally small, with two parents and one or two children. However, this pattern is changing as fewer people marry. Relationships with extended family are different depending on each family. In the UK, it is rare for three generations to live in the same home. In some families in the UK, grandparents help raise children, especially while a single parent works.

                        British children tend to live at home with their parents until completing university or getting a job. As a result, their parents often support them financially until their early twenties. In the UK, adult children don’t feel obligated to care for their aging parents the same way as other cultures.

                    <h3>Teenage Life in the United Kingdom</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most children attend either a primary school (from ages 5 to 11) and a secondary school (starting at age 11). Public schools are called state schools, and private schools may be called independent schools or public schools. In state schools, education is free. A variety of sports are played by teenagers in the UK, including golf, Gaelic football, rugby, and football (soccer). Football is the most popular sport in the UK. Most have an extreme loyalty to a professional football team, and football is a popular conversation point.

                    <h3>Official Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        English is the main language of the UK, though it is different from the U.S. in terms of spelling, pronunciation, and pitch.

                    <h3>Communication Styles</h3>
                    <p>
                        The British typically favor an indirect communication style. Generally, they avoid conflict and err on the side of politeness in conversation. Often, their messaging may be vague to maintain social harmony. Qualifiers such as “perhaps,” or “possibly” are common. Absolute statements may be perceived as suspicious. It is common for the British to understate their fondness for something. Generally, people are not overly demonstrative with their emotions. To appear humble and relaxed about their self-image, self-deprecation is a popular form of humor in British culture. A dry wit is often appreciated.
